A **toy** Perceptron application made in C, for *educational purposes*!

>"In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.[1] It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector."

This implementation of the Perceptron algorithm is made in *pure* C. The learning rule is used as an optimization function and the threshold/step function for activation.

Features to be added:
1. Variety of activation functions
2. Variety of cost functions
